<p>The solution helps you free up staff so they can focus on providing quality service to your customers. It may seem like just a minor detail or one more box you have to check while setting up your small business, but choosing a functional and affordable credit card processor can have a huge impact on your company's bottom line. It provides recipe management and food costing, purchase management, stock management and inventory, along with a powerful reporting capability.</p>

Vend is a good option for very small businesses, as it can support one register, 10 products, and up to 1,000 customers each month.

<p>As much as possible, go for a POS that can boost profits by providing a fast and efficient check-out process, manage inventory and sales reports, and provide income generating programs like loyalty rewards and discount promos. Cash registers are not as evolved as using a POS system and lack many of the functions and features of a modern day point of sale system like Square Point of Sale A cash register could be considered a point of sale solution technically, however, for our definitions, we will be focusing on point-of-sale machines (aka POS terminals) that involve both software and hardware.</p>
