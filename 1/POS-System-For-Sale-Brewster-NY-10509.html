<h2>Point Of Sale Basics Brewster NY</h2>
<p>Restaurant owners were quick to realize that just acquiring customers was not enough. By integrating your POS system with the ERP system, Business Central , you avoid entering the same data in multiple systems as all transactions are posted automatically. A proper POS system can streamline your retail outlet & saves time, a flawed one can complicate even the little things, thus making the process of checkout frustrating for anyone at the payment counter.</p>
<p>Customer data capture and management are key in the development of our retail systems and Retail Pro allows for much improved processes and usability in terms of CRM and stock management. For example, having your inventory data visibility across stores means when your store is out of stock on a particular product, sales associates can check its availability at other locations. Food and drink sectors like restaurants require a different set of features in the POS software than retailers.</p>
<p>You avoid entering the same data twice as all sales are automatically registered in the accounts. The price, lower than most POS software services in the restaurant business, is also a big selling point. We customized the user interface to include fields for the exact data we need to sell online - things like name, subname, item, weight, dimensions, UPC, and at least three photos which we get from our wholesalers.</p>
