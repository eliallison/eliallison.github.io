<h3>What Are The Best Retail Point Of Sale (POS) Systems In Palm Beach Florida</h3>
<p>Restaurants are one business that can truly take advantage of using hand held PCs for order placement. However, a POS purchase can happen anywhere with the increase in mobile payment terminals. Because traditional point of sale systems require you to run reports from an in-store terminal, your ability to make data-driven business decisions is limited to when you're at your business location. Vend enables ease of sale, regardless of whether retailers use Vend's responsive web-based POS on PC, Mac or the Vend Register iPad app.</p>

This was the first commercially available POS system with a widget-driven color graphic touch screen interface and was installed in several restaurants in the US and Canada.</p>
