<p>The newest revelations to take the restaurant and hospitality industries by force - quickly etching its way into "trendsetter" capacity - are point-of-sale systems that are powered by feature-rich and slim iPad tablets. In modern terms, a POS system is typically a POS software product installed on a touchscreen hardware device. Maitre'D POS by Posera is a POS software designed for quick service and full table service restaurants, nightclubs, and bars. The Revel Bar POS system is equipped with tools to help entrepreneurs maximize their bar business. Features allow restaurants to create table maps, easily update menu items and monitor sales in real time through the Upserve mobile app.</p>

It is interesting because you get a feel of sitting in a store and executing your test cases since POS requires setup as you would see in any stores. This all-inclusive system is a platform for staff management, inventory control, back office management, reporting, and marketing. Now how the software works is that every time an item is scanned it will be deducted from the inventory database.</p>
