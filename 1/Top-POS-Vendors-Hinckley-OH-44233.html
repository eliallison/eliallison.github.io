This free POS software can perform all of the common register functions, track up to 13,000 SKU's, monitor sales of up to 56 employees, and handle daily sales reporting. When we started, we used to write all of our sales on a piece of paper, but soon we realised that we needed an efficient POS to automate our work.</p>
<p>We believe that restaurant point of sale and inventory management software should be mobile and affordable. Customers rate their experience alerting managers when a patron isn't satisfied with the service. Some POS providers will give you a mobile card reader for free, while others will charge you upwards of $1,000 for a POS hardware bundle.
