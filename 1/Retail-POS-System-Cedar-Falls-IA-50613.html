<p>For any restaurant, point of sale technology is important. What Imonggo's free plan doesn't offer is broad integration capabilities, offline access, or the option to accept credit card payments.

With core functionalities built around inventory management, ecommerce, analytics, and customer loyalty, it helps you boost product management as well as track and organize customer data.</p>

<p>Retailers can reasonably expect to acquire such systems (including hardware) for about $4000 US (as of 2009) per checkout lane. For old-school, on-premise systems, the cash register was the POS terminal. To get the best deal on your retail POS system, look for companies that offer month-to-month contracts and open-source POS hardware. Read real customer reviews to see why retailers choose Cumulus Retail over other retail management and ePOS systems, such as Lightspeed, Springboard, Vend, Shopkeep and more.</p>

It allows businesses to boost service quality while offering data reporting and order tracking capabilities.</p>
