<p>In the Point of Sale QuickBooks software you are able to process non-posting transactions that promise customers something in the future, as Sales Orders, Work Orders and Layaways. This restaurant POS gives managers control over guest reservations, inventory management, staff management, and more. MPOS systems are used to process payments and may have other capabilities such as inventory management , loyalty programs, sales monitoring, reporting and much more. The software is what registers, processes and stores transaction details, but there are crucial differences in how it is stored and used between different POS software systems.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>
