Choose from our wide range of offerings to design a comprehensive restaurant POS and management solution for your business. Take a variety of payments with the Square magstripe reader, offer customers digital receipts and track sales in real-time.</p>
<p>The POS unit handles the sales to the consumer but it is only one part of the entire POS system used in a retail business.

Either one of these will help brick and mortar retailers switch to an easier to use and more affordable POS. Another function of this mPOS is its connectivity to our Supply Chain Management (SCM) and Head Office (HO) software system.</p>
<p>There is also the possibility for order kiosks, allowing customers to place their own orders directly into the POS system and bypassing servers entirely. We'll start with what POS software can do. As a reminder, the point of sale software is what you use in conjunction with POS hardware to run transactions. At many foodservice, retail, and hospitality businesses, the Point Of Sale (POS) system or Property Management System (PMS) has a built-in time and attendance system which may be sufficient.</p>
