<p>Trying to manage and grow a restaurant using old, antiquated processes like hand written order slips is a huge waste of time and energy. A credit card swipe is integrated with the POS system to quickly and accurately approve the customer's credit card and to input the transaction into the system. IVend POS is Windows OS based software that allows for a variety of peripherals and device configurations, including scanners, cash drawers, displays and EMV-compliant card readers. That's because it's the software that lets you track sales, issue receipts, and perform back-office functions.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>
<h2>How Much Does A Restaurant POS System Cost In Blacksburg</h2>
<p>POS systems like Lightspeed can integrate with payment processors to automatically transit information between your inventory system and card reader. You don't need a valid internet connection to run this restaurant POS software. Payments can be by cash or credit and debit cards, or via convenient payment gateways. For example, allowing your vendors to monitor your inventory levels in real time through a POS system reduces - even eliminates - product shortages.</p>
<p>Smartwerks is cloud-based POS software for specialty retail such as gift and hobby shops, jewelry boutiques, and furniture stores. Jesta's Vision Store irons out your POS kinks so satisfaction and, in turn, sales grow. Startup restaurants are often cash-strapped and need a POS solution that has what they need, doesn't cost too much and doesn't get them stuck in a long contract. These applications extend beyond the retail POS setting, and Biometric Fingerprint images are stored and available for prosecution by law enforcement.</p>
<p>Point-of-sale systems, as a result, are basically cash registers on steroids.” POS software expanded the basics of the cash register directly into credit card payment processors and back-end accounting. Since the point-of-sale system was now keeping an individual record for each inventory item, retailers wanted to maintain their stocking levels in the computer. From inventory management and sales tracking, to sales reporting and customer loyalty programs, AIMsi covers it all.</p>

It offers a POS, multi-outlet retail capability, and an inventory management system, allowing you to run your business, whether online, in-store or on the go. Lightspeed charges 2.6% + 10¢ for payment processing (the same rate as Square for Restaurants) but can also integrate with outside payment processors, which you might prefer to use if you can secure a better rate elsewhere.</p>
