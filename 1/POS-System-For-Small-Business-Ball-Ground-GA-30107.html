With CRM integration, the Point Of Sale software for restaurants can acquire customer feedback, analyze and generate reports based on customer behavior. If all you need is to have a total amount of cash in the drawer that sometimes matches to the amount of sales shown you probably don't need a point of sale system.</p>
<p>Any form of payment can be used, such as cash, debit cards, credit cards, mobile payments, and even accumulated loyalty points. If you're currently using Shopify to sell online, or plan to expand your retail stores into the ecommerce space, then I highly recommend the Shopify POS system.
