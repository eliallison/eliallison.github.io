<p>Shopify POS is a service that's easy to set up and highly customizable to fit small businesses and scale up as your business grows. The Basic plan gives you a few more in-store features, but it is the Shopify and Advanced Shopify that really gives you enough to run a serious brick and mortar store - with an online Shopify store.
