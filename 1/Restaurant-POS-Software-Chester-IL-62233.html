<p>When you are just getting started with a new retail business and are wondering whether you should install one or more retail POS software and retail POS hardware, then in this article we will discuss three distinct advantages of retail point of sale, POS, solution over the usual cash register solution. While point of sale systems come in many shapes, sizes, and price tags, we are only going to focus on one type of POS system in this article. It helps to increase sales, improve service, and review reports to check on the performance of servers. Celerant, Intuit, MICROS Retail, Microsoft, NCR, Oracle, and SAP are the most popular POS software solution providers. In order to take payment from cards with a chip, your credit card reader will need to accept what is known as EMV payment â€”a global standard for chip-based debit and credit card transactions.</p>
<p>By making customer experience a central focus, retailers can transform their businesses to deliver unified, personalized customer experiences in-store, online, on the go and on a mobile or tablet device. The best POS vendors provide reliable customer support that you can contact around the clock, so even if your business keeps irregular hours or you're working late, you can receive help when you need it. These fees will be charged to your business based on how many transactions you run, how large each transaction is, and the type of card the customer is paying with.</p>

<p>There is also the possibility for order kiosks, allowing customers to place their own orders directly into the POS system and bypassing servers entirely. We'll start with what POS software can do. As a reminder, the point of sale software is what you use in conjunction with POS hardware to run transactions.

The $29 Basic Shopify plan is an affordable option for smaller retail businesses, but only if you're selling products exclusively online.
