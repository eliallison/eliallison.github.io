<p>Grow with an all-in-one solution for financial management, inventory, reporting, and customer service. We culled seven of the best POS systems depending on a restaurant's particular needs. Your bar customer is paying the same amount as a customer in the restaurant. Both our POS apps offer a fast checkout, daily sales reports, seamless accounting integration and smart stock management. The Lightspeed Point of Sale system is also listed among the top POS systems with its amazing set of features and high-level performance.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>

<p>However, ShopKeep has a strong set of features that makes it suitable for smaller, quick-service restaurants. When choosing the best POS system for your bar, it is important to factor in the features you need and your available budget.

There is only 1 thing we can think of that will drive customers away faster than bad food and that is slow service.</p>
