<p>Although a POS system is an essential tool for any retail store, it shouldn't be the only one you have in your arsenal. Some restaurant POS systems offer these features as an integrated part of their system, but many do not. With CRM integration, the Point Of Sale software for restaurants can acquire customer feedback, analyze and generate reports based on customer behavior. If all you need is to have a total amount of cash in the drawer that sometimes matches to the amount of sales shown you probably don't need a point of sale system.</p>

I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc.</p>
