<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>
<p>ShopKeep is also less-than-forthcoming about its transaction fees for payments processed through its ShopKeep Payments systems.

Shopkeep software increases sales and provides your customers the convenience to pay using several ways. Just create weekly and monthly reports of financial statements using a comprehensive restaurant management software.</p>
