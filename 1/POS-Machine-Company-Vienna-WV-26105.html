<p>If you run a retail store, you know that a point of sale system is essential, especially in food retailing, where large volumes of goods go through the check out. In addition, some states (such as California) now require some kind of customer-facing screen be available so customers can view sales information as a sale is rung up. Your point of sale should help you automate and optimize how you manage your business's inventory. Give your bartenders possibility to quickly and accurately serve customers and create a unique atmosphere for your bar. So, of course, restaurants handled most of their management stuff manually.</p>
<p>You may be able to use all or most of your existing hardware when you add Lightspeed to your business—speak to your sales rep for more information. Managers can also keep track of profits, inventory, menu trends, and other analytics. And if you want to do business online as well as in person, some POS systems offer the ability to create an online store that will pull from the same inventory database as your brick-and-mortar store.</p>

<p>Point of sale equipment allows faster payment service thereby reducing the amount of time a shopper has to wait to pay for their items.
