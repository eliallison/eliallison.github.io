<p>If you run a retail store, you know that a point of sale system is essential, especially in food retailing, where large volumes of goods go through the check out. In addition, some states (such as California) now require some kind of customer-facing screen be available so customers can view sales information as a sale is rung up. Your point of sale should help you automate and optimize how you manage your business's inventory. Give your bartenders possibility to quickly and accurately serve customers and create a unique atmosphere for your bar. So, of course, restaurants handled most of their management stuff manually.</p>
<p>The system should facilitate the creation of multiple returns for one sales order at different time intervals. Along with an easy-to-use tablet point of sale, NCR Silver Pro Restaurant is a cloud-based POS software that delivers added benefits such as happy hour pricing, customized floor plans and house accounts valued by full service restaurants and pubs. If you plan to integrate your POS system with other software and services - such as accounting software, CMS platforms, customer loyalty programs and appointment management apps - you'll want to find out ahead of time if the integration costs extra, and whether it's a one-time or recurring fee.</p>

<h2>Hospitality Point Of Sale Systems Goleta CA</h2>

More sophisticated POS software will actually compile data on purchases, customer history (so that big spenders can get premiere treatment), what items are moving well and what items stay stagnant. When staff members spend more time with your guests, your bar or nightclub's efficiency and reputation drastically improve.</p>
<p>But, make no mistake about it. A restaurant POS system doesn't come in the form of a software application only. It takes the payment of the customers by adding up the totals along with the sales tax. While ringing up customer purchases, the system makes it easy for the bartender to add a gratuity, split tabs evenly or separate checks whenever required to. Furthermore, it can serve as an advertising platform, where stores can run marketing messages and promotions, thereby potentially enhancing sales.</p>
