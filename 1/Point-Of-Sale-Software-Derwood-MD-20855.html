<p>The core of hospitality or retail business, for that matter any trade, is the cash register. A POS system provides the latest sales reports for the day, week, month, or year. You'll want to use POS software that integrates seamlessly with your other systems and causes limited disruption. In essence, Upserve POS provides tools for customer management, restaurant management, table management, and specialty order processing. Some restaurant point of sale systems come standard with an "86 Item Countdown" feature that displays actual counts, deducts from the count when an item is sold and then prevents sales of the item once it is sold out.</p>
<p>POS systems still include both software and hardware components, but they now also offer many new functions as well. Retail merchants, for example, can operate with an internet-enabled device, terminal stand, credit card reader, receipt printer, and cash drawer. Once again, here's our quick look at the three POS services that rise above the rest when it comes to features, support, and pricing. HDRestaurant will come in handy in those situations, from billing to storing the addresses of the customer; the restaurant software takes care of everything easily.</p>

<p>ShopKeep also runs on Clover devices, such as Clover Station and Clover Mini Though it doesn't include as many industry-specific features as some other systems, ShopKeep has an affordable price point (monthly rates are customized for each business) and has a lot to offer in the areas of inventory and employee management. It allows businesses to boost service quality while offering data reporting and order tracking capabilities.</p>

Our projects range from single-purpose tasks for small businesses to highly complex, multi-platform systems for large corporate clients.</p>
<p>These registers have been replaced by technology known as point of sale (POS) systems; which nowadays are highly sophisticated and are the backbone of any business where sales are involved. The $29 Basic Shopify plan is an affordable option for smaller retail businesses, but only if you're selling products exclusively online. Disregarding that fact for the time being, compare a retail store with a POS System to an almost identical store with a standard electronic cash register - there are much differences than first meets the eye.</p>
