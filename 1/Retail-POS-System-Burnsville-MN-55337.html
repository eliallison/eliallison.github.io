<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years. But without inventory management software, it is exactly that: counting. Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>
<p>POS systems let retailers track their inventory across multiple stores in different locations. These options may also encourage your customers to spend more money at your business. You can connect the POS system with most-used business applications and payment systems, like Paypal, Xero, and Quickbooks. In addition to helping owners and operators detect theft through detailed sales and inventory reporting, some bar and nightclub POS systems also offer cash drawer management to further protect against employee theft.</p>

<p>Retailers can reasonably expect to acquire such systems (including hardware) for about $4000 US (as of 2009) per checkout lane. For old-school, on-premise systems, the cash register was the POS terminal. To get the best deal on your retail POS system, look for companies that offer month-to-month contracts and open-source POS hardware. Read real customer reviews to see why retailers choose Cumulus Retail over other retail management and ePOS systems, such as Lightspeed, Springboard, Vend, Shopkeep and more.</p>

<p>Many owners and manages find that the reports generated from the POS system invaluable in the day-to-day and long term management of the business. Meanwhile, the Smart Table Management gives you the real-time status of your tables so that you can keep a close tab on orders and payments.

<p>Manage your business with a robust iPad POS system. Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city. There is only 1 thing we can think of that will drive customers away faster than bad food and that is slow service.</p>
