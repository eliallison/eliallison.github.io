<p>It is a must in retail stores earning revenue above $7, 00,000. Nightclub or bar POS software with preauthorization will also immediately tokenize and encrypt customer credit card information when it's swiped, so no sensitive information is stored on the device. While a cash register only stores money and is often attached to a computer or bar code scanner a point of sale or POS does this all in one interface.</p>
<p>With the POS software, you don't need terminals, cash registers, barcode scanners, or receipt and label printers. But just because you have someone on the phone doesn't mean your system is back online; you're still losing revenue every time an impatient customer walks out of the store. For a restaurant, it's especially important to turn over tables quickly and ensure that customers receive the correct food (with any special orders accommodated) in a timely fashion.</p>
