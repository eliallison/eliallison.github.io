<p>Bar staff often work without direct supervision and liquor waste and theft is hard to detect or prevent. Many systems also feature add-on modules such as payroll time clocks and customer preference databases. Technological advances such as point of sale systems, email ordering and computerized kitchens have taken fast service to a new level. Flexibility - At this point, many POS transactions are card-based, not cash-based. ShopKeep can be used for payment processing, inventory management, transactions, customer marketing, staff management, reporting and analytics, and more.</p>
<p>We created Point of Success Special Edition for independent restaurants, coffee shops, cafes, bars, and quick service concepts like yours. The one thing that can take a long time when hiring a bartender for the first time is training them to learn your POS system. It comes with modules for material management, inventory, billing and kitchen management. Cost-effective - Cloud POS systems generally cost a monthly subscription fee without any contractual obligations - this can remove the entry point for a quality system without spending thousands of dollars upfront for software licensing.</p>

Our Point of Sale systems are compatible with all popular payment processors and gateways, while others give you one or two options.</p>

For the purpose of rationalizing of everyday activities, a POS system is very beneficial to small and big businesses alike.</p>
