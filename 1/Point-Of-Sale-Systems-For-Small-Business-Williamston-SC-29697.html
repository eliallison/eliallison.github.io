POS systems come with a wide variety of features and add-ons. Whether you need to transfer tickets between waitstaff, change tables, split customer checks, adjust the price or quantity of an item, quickly duplicate previously ordered items, manage gratuity and taxes or better manage any other variety of other tasks, the right POS solution will have you covered.</p>
<p>The faster a sale is completed the shorter the queue time which improves customer satisfaction, and the less space it takes, which benefits shoppers and staff.

<h3>Desktop POS System Williamston South Carolina</h3>
<p>It uses a powerful POS technology that allows you to track your inventory in real-time and offer your customers a more flexible payment processing. It is also seen as the preferred deployment method of many businesses owing to the low price tags that come with cloud-based tools And then there is the projected increase in the use of self-service kiosks, not only by restaurants but among retailers as well. Loyal, regular customers are the lifeblood of any bar.</p>
<p>Any form of payment can be used, such as cash, debit cards, credit cards, mobile payments, and even accumulated loyalty points.
