From full service establishments to quick service franchises we have matched hundreds of independent restauranteurs throughout the country with the POS system they need to realize lasting success in a highly competitive industry. Point of sale (POS), a critical piece of a point of purchase , refers to the place where a customer executes the payment for goods or services and where sales taxes may become payable.</p>
