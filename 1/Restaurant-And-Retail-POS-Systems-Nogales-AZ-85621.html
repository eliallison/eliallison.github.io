<p>Onetap is hospitality point of sale, stock control, customer loyalty, reporting and integrated software using smart technology for restaurants, cafes, bars and more. You also get dashboards, retail, and product report to gain insights into your store's growth and sales performance. If you already own a PC you can "create" a POS by purchasing the POS software and adding the peripherals you will need such as a cash drawer, credit card swiper, etc. High-traffic operations such as grocery outlets and cafes need to process sales quickly at the sales counter so the UI flow is often designed with as few popups or other interruptions to ensure the operator isn't distracted and the transaction can be processed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Retailers and restaurants can benefit from comprehensive data analytics and sales processing. One thing to watch out for is that sometimes these features are included in the basic monthly software fee while other times they need to be purchased, upping the price. Below we have compiled some of the most popular types of POS systems and what features and tools they usually come with to help you figure out what will most benefit your business.</p>

With this software, you can increase your sales, track inventories, manage employees, and automate restaurant operations conveniently using your tablet.
