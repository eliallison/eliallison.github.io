<p>Trying to manage and grow a restaurant using old, antiquated processes like hand written order slips is a huge waste of time and energy. A credit card swipe is integrated with the POS system to quickly and accurately approve the customer's credit card and to input the transaction into the system. IVend POS is Windows OS based software that allows for a variety of peripherals and device configurations, including scanners, cash drawers, displays and EMV-compliant card readers. That's because it's the software that lets you track sales, issue receipts, and perform back-office functions.</p>
<p>When you're shopping around for a POS system, keep in mind the different types of restaurant technology and bar management software out there. Manage multiple warehouses- move stock between different businesses with the stock management system. Effectively communicate with customers and increase your sales with strategically targeted promotional emails. Scheduling employees and staying on top of their hours is possible from the POS too, and our POS can be integrated with your payroll management software.</p>
<h2>Cloud Retail POS Software North Reading</h2>
<p>Although each business is unique, the typical POS hardware you need for your retail business includes a tablet and stand, cash drawer, barcode scanner, and receipt printer. The type of retail software a small business chooses depends on the type of business, size of the business, amount of sales, and the type and amount of inventory. Expand your customer base, manage inventory and sales, and perform and monitor other functions at any time from anywhere.</p>
<p>It works just like any POS you'll find in a retail store, but because it's cloud based point of sale software (runs in a web browser) it works on any computer or iPad in the world.

The Foodie365cloud is a ready to use restaurant software for fine dining restaurants, take away and quick service restaurants, bar, clubs and disco.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, there have been several advancements in restaurant POS Before we look at how the restaurant point of sale system has evolved over the years, let us first define what exactly is a point of sale system. As in other software industries, many POS vendors have cloud-based SaaS (software as a service) plans that you subscribe to. These tend to be the most affordable options. The cash only retail business is quickly fading into obscurity.</p>

<p>You can choose your own credit card processor to cut the best possible deal.

By implementing this solution in your bar or nightclub you will be in a better position to overcome the chaos that is commonly associated with the rush in the business.</p>
