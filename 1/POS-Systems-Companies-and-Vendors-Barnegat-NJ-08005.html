<p>If you are planning on starting a new retail business, or run a retail business and wish to streamline your operation, a crucial component that should be factored into your business plans is a modern day point of sale system and more precisely the benefits a good POS system can offer to the running of your business. Acquire, retain and engage your customers, increase their average spend, manage inventory and visualize sales analytics. Wearables like Disney's Magicband may seem relegated to expensive experiences for now, but wearable computing will soon change how restaurants interact with customers and accept payment. Shopkeep POS has the best Retail POS System mobile app on the market. Understanding the basics of how point-of-sale (POS) systems work and the implementation process is essential to know, especially if you're looking to buy a new system.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>

With an online POS, you can use your own hardware. Toast POS is one of the few providers of an Android POS system, which is more suitable for restaurants due to the flexibility and affordability of the Android infrastructure.</p>
<p>A few services, such as Square Point of Sale, offer POS services for free, as long as you process your payments through them. Tracking sales and inventory, renting videos and equipment, creating membership accounts, look ups by category, and managing your store's books are just a few of the features.

<p>Also, since your revenues will rise, spending time on forecasting and analysis will have a bigger return on investment, so we added features of a POS system that will help you with forecasting as well. Another advantage associated with Point of Sale software for restaurants is its real-time integration with inventory management. It is wise to use the POS computer for only sales transactions, reports, and inventory control, and isolate use of POS computers from general purpose activities.</p>
<p>The server stores all the data which relates to the Point of Sale system, allowing the information to be locked into one secure location. Increase efficiency by integrating your point of sale with the other technologies you use, including payment terminals, accounting software, employee scheduling tools, loyalty programs and more.

STEM is an integrated suite of retail and hospitality management modules that enable you to manage your businesses successfully and maximize profits.

<p>Any form of payment can be used, such as cash, debit cards, credit cards, mobile payments, and even accumulated loyalty points. If you're currently using Shopify to sell online, or plan to expand your retail stores into the ecommerce space, then I highly recommend the Shopify POS system.
