<p>POS software is what brick and mortar retailers use to conduct sales. Accept cash, checks, credit cards or even multiple payment types on any transaction. Hence, if you get installed right or needed hardware at your business place, you will get maximum flexibility and speediness in providing services to the potential customers. A proper compliance POS system allows retailers to protect customers' privileges and gain their trust and loyalty.</p>

Its rich features with no hidden fees make it lucrative for many small businesses. EPOS has a lot of very specific configuration options, perfectly suited for cafe, restaurant, and bar owners.
