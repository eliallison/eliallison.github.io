<p>Choosing your point of sale, or POS, systems could be a disaster if you approach the wrong dealer and go for the wrong equipment. This training is for you if you want to grow your business using a powerful customer experience formula proven to make your cash register chirp.

Combined with Upserves HQ and Upserve Payments, Upserve POS delivers the most advanced POS and restaurant management solution in the industry, purpose-built to improve guest experiences.</p>
<p>Some restaurants are adopting a customer-facing POS with tabletop devices providing upsells and remote service.

Different types of restaurants have specific operational needs that must be met, and a good POS system must address those needs through the basic hardware as well as the software interface.</p>

Simply explained, every time your customer purchases your business, they're completing a point of the sale transaction. Most POS companies will program your menu or inventory items as an existing customer or additionally for a fee.</p>
