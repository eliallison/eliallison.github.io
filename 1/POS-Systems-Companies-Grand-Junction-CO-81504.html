<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years. But without inventory management software, it is exactly that: counting. Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>
<p>When you're shopping around for a POS system, keep in mind the different types of restaurant technology and bar management software out there. Manage multiple warehouses- move stock between different businesses with the stock management system. Effectively communicate with customers and increase your sales with strategically targeted promotional emails. Scheduling employees and staying on top of their hours is possible from the POS too, and our POS can be integrated with your payroll management software.</p>
