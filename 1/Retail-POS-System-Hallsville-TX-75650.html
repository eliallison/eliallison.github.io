<h3>How IPad POS Changes The Way Businesses Operate Hallsville Texas</h3>
<p>With several bar-specific features like bar tabs management, it has become a favorite among bar owners. POS (Point of Sale) transaction takes place between a merchant and a customer when a service or product purchased. With it, you not only get access to payment processing tools and inventory management features but also customer management functionalities. In Shanghai, the famous French supermarket chain Auchan has inaugurated two new stores with no cashiers or shop assistants - customers enter and purchase products via their mobile phones.</p>

For a restaurant, it's especially important to turn over tables quickly and ensure that customers receive the correct food (with any special orders accommodated) in a timely fashion.</p>
