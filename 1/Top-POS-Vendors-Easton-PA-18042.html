Choosing a POS software vendor that offers proprietary hardware can save you time while offering smoother functionality. Easy to use - Tablet and mobile POS are easier to use because the staff is already familiar with using mobile devices so that the learning curve can be shorter over the traditional point of sale machines and software.
