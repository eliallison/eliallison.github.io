Some packages are designed specifically for food and beverage service businesses, like TouchBistro and Toast.

<p>If you bar code all of your merchandise than you can not only save time in checking customers out and implementing markdowns instantly, but also you can eliminate the problem of switched price tags. That feature is a key for busy restaurants: Toast Go also means servers can run customer credit cards right at the table and have the receipt emailed to them. With older POS systems, managers had a lot more workload.</p>

Retail 4.0 stores such as Amazon Go would shift point-of-sale purchases to e-commerce wherein customers would be making transactions with their smartphones instead of swiping cards.
