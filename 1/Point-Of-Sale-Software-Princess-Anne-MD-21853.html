<p>Brick and mortar retailers are moving toward leaner systems that operate on tablets and smartphones, not complicated systems that cost thousands of dollars. A good POS system can speed up payment times, help waiters or bar staff to take large orders, and help kitchen staff to manage output effectively. You can't expect your clients to enjoy there shopping if they stand in a queue for 15 - 20 minutes, so be sure the point of sale (POS) retail side is fast.</p>
<p>Harbortouch TablesideTM allows your restaurant's servers to input customer orders directly from the table via an Apple® iPad® for a dramatic increase in speed, service quality, and efficiency.
