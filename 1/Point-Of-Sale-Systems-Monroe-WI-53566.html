<p>One of the biggest advantages provided by the modern day POS systems is the help they can offer you by tracking your inventory levels. Whatever the case may be, there seems to be a misconception out there that retail point of sale (POS) systems can work as substitutes for a restaurant POS and that notion is just plain wrong.

It provides flexible reporting and cost & labor saving inventory management tools that help identify vulnerable areas of the business. If you are planning a very small operation, such as bagel or sandwich shop, you may not need a POS system at the opening time, especially if you aren't going to take credit cards (and there are plenty of places that still don't accept plastic).</p>
