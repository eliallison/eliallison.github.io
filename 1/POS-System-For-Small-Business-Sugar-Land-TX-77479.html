<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years. But without inventory management software, it is exactly that: counting. Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>
<p>The POS serves as the central component for your business ; it's the hub where everything—like sales, inventory and customer management—merges. Most of you are familiar with point of sale (POS) systems, even if you don't realize it.

Whether you're serving drinks at happy hour, serving customers a quick meal or brewing up the latest imported coffee bean, eHopper is made for multiple types of small businesses.</p>
