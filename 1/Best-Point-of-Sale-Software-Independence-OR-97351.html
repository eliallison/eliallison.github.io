<p>Trying to manage and grow a restaurant using old, antiquated processes like hand written order slips is a huge waste of time and energy. A credit card swipe is integrated with the POS system to quickly and accurately approve the customer's credit card and to input the transaction into the system. IVend POS is Windows OS based software that allows for a variety of peripherals and device configurations, including scanners, cash drawers, displays and EMV-compliant card readers. That's because it's the software that lets you track sales, issue receipts, and perform back-office functions.</p>

Expand your customer base, manage inventory and sales, and perform and monitor other functions at any time from anywhere.</p>
<p>Point of sales systems of today function analogously to the commonplace personal computer and can run other software other than the standard POS software that is provided as standard with the purchase of the system. The Point of Sale (POS) is simply the place where a retail transaction takes place-it's the hardware and software used to physically accept payments and record transactions. To ensure that you do not sell to persons below 21 years of age, consider getting a POS system that can verify your customers' ages.</p>
