This restaurant POS gives managers control over guest reservations, inventory management, staff management, and more. MPOS systems are used to process payments and may have other capabilities such as inventory management , loyalty programs, sales monitoring, reporting and much more. The software is what registers, processes and stores transaction details, but there are crucial differences in how it is stored and used between different POS software systems.</p>
<p>The platform comes equipped with a robust inventory management feature allowing you to customize categories and settings.
