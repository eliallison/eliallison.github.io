<p>In the Point of Sale QuickBooks software you are able to process non-posting transactions that promise customers something in the future, as Sales Orders, Work Orders and Layaways. This restaurant POS gives managers control over guest reservations, inventory management, staff management, and more. MPOS systems are used to process payments and may have other capabilities such as inventory management , loyalty programs, sales monitoring, reporting and much more. The software is what registers, processes and stores transaction details, but there are crucial differences in how it is stored and used between different POS software systems.</p>
<p>The platform comes equipped with a robust inventory management feature allowing you to customize categories and settings. CAKE, from Sysco, built its POS to meet the demands of Quick & Full Service restaurants. A member database that supports targeted marketing such as coupons and points schemes has high value in increasing sales and keeping customers.

Businesses that experience the most success with their point-of-sale systems are ones who have a great POS company supporting them.
