As the most popular mobile card reader company in the UK, this app is widely used by small shops who do not need very advanced features at their point of sale. It automatically updates the essential database from customers, products, inventory, sales, loyalty programs and labor. Cashier Live's software help businesses ring up sales with ease, as well as tracking inventory, managing staff, accessing data and generating reports.</p>
