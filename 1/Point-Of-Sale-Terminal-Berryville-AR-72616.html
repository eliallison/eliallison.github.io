<p>The right Point of Sale system will give you control over many different areas of your business operations increasing efficiency and profitability. Accept cash, credit card or other tender, then swipe for tableside service. Mobile POS systems are Cloud-based and substantially cheaper (but may be leaner in terms of extras). Features include order management, inventory tracking, a timeclock and sales analytics. The capturing of data at the time and place of sales by using personal computers or specialized terminals that are combined with cash registers, bar code readers, optical scanners and magnetic stripe readers for accurately and instantly capturing the transaction.</p>
<p>POS systems still include both software and hardware components, but they now also offer many new functions as well. Retail merchants, for example, can operate with an internet-enabled device, terminal stand, credit card reader, receipt printer, and cash drawer. Once again, here's our quick look at the three POS services that rise above the rest when it comes to features, support, and pricing. HDRestaurant will come in handy in those situations, from billing to storing the addresses of the customer; the restaurant software takes care of everything easily.</p>
