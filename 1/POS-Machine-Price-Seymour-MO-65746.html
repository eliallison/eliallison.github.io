ShopKeep was founded by a retailer, so we get that no two businesses are alike. A sleek POS can also give your business a modern, professional feel that may impress customers.</p>
<p>Point of sales systems of today function analogously to the commonplace personal computer and can run other software other than the standard POS software that is provided as standard with the purchase of the system. The Point of Sale (POS) is simply the place where a retail transaction takes place-it's the hardware and software used to physically accept payments and record transactions. To ensure that you do not sell to persons below 21 years of age, consider getting a POS system that can verify your customers' ages.</p>
<p>This type of software can be easily installed on your POS terminal or tablet and has a wide range of capabilities - a notable one being the ability for you to store and view your sales data online. Refund the past orders to gift cards, store credit or back to the customer by using the original payment method. Most popular restaurant POS systems offer a free trial or demo of their product.

<p>The biggest change in point-of-sale over the past few years are the affordable options available for small, or even micro, businesses available.
