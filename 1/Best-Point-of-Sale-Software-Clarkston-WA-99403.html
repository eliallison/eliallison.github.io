<p>This feature has been around since I started in the cash register business some 25+ years ago. Formerly known as iConnect, Franpos provides POS solutions with comprehensive features to franchise businesses. Our Point of Sale for Restaurants offers full stock control, debtors, creditors, recipe and staff management to manage your entire restaurant alongside all the great features that are required to keep you informed on what is happening in your business. It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>
<p>Gone are those days when retailers used a cash register to process sales after which the data was transferred to accounts and stock list. It's a proven fact that when customers open bar tabs, they spend more. Whether you have single or multiple stores, our tools help run your business. A decent POS computer system provides features to manage a large company database, that can be conceivably shared amongst multiple store locations.</p>
<h2>POS Systems For Restaurants, Bars & Nightclubs Clarkston</h2>
<p>It's imperative to choose the restaurant management software that best suits your business requirements. Price-wise, it would have been an approximate £25,000 project at the time for five stores, with ongoing licence costs as well as website costs and additional licence fees as more stores opened. A robust and configurable Retail Point of Sales (POS) software application powering 3000+ installations globally. Square is listed as one of the topmost brands in Point of Sale systems and the set of features, services and price ranges associated with this POS are second to none.</p>
<p>This tool enables the app to receive and handle payments using credit or debit cards, straight from your mobile gadget.

<p>A big portion of these business owners are afraid of investing the time and money in a POS system to only end up regretting it because it just didn't work as they had hoped for. It used to be that smaller businesses could not easily process credit card and check payments. ShopKeep's tablet POS system empowers you to strategically place staff throughout the store, minimizing long wait times during peak business hours.</p>
