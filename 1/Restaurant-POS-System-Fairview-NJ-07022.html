<p>The core of hospitality or retail business, for that matter any trade, is the cash register. A POS system provides the latest sales reports for the day, week, month, or year. You'll want to use POS software that integrates seamlessly with your other systems and causes limited disruption. In essence, Upserve POS provides tools for customer management, restaurant management, table management, and specialty order processing. Some restaurant point of sale systems come standard with an "86 Item Countdown" feature that displays actual counts, deducts from the count when an item is sold and then prevents sales of the item once it is sold out.</p>
<p>Your customers become your shop's ultimate cheerleader, speaking positively about you within their social circles and essentially attracting new customers for you. Consolidate your inventory, customer, and staff management across all locations so that you can manage your entire business from one place. Reduced time for management to compute employee hours. POS systems also offer reliable add-ons and hardware systems such as barcode scanners, cash drawers, receipt printers, and card swipers.</p>

<p>Focus POS empowers you to control labor costs, efficiently manage inventory, and have deeper visibility into your business.

We finally did and are glad to not have this stress of a failing pos system with awful customer service. We provide with various types of POS application development including restaurants, bar, cafes, retail business and much more.</p>
<p>We believe that restaurant point of sale and inventory management software should be mobile and affordable. Customers rate their experience alerting managers when a patron isn't satisfied with the service. Some POS providers will give you a mobile card reader for free, while others will charge you upwards of $1,000 for a POS hardware bundle.
