<p>This feature has been around since I started in the cash register business some 25+ years ago. Formerly known as iConnect, Franpos provides POS solutions with comprehensive features to franchise businesses. Our Point of Sale for Restaurants offers full stock control, debtors, creditors, recipe and staff management to manage your entire restaurant alongside all the great features that are required to keep you informed on what is happening in your business. It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>
<p>Expiry Management: This software for restaurant billing in India assists in tracking expiry date of ingredients, so that you can return items to suppliers on time. Card payment starts by swiping the card - through MSR or a handheld device then taking customer's authorization for the specified amount. Plus, Cova is seed-to-sale compliant, integrating with statewide traceability systems like BioTrackTHC, Leaf Data Systems, and Metrc.</p>
<h2>Benefits A Business Gets By Using POS Software And Inventory Management Essex</h2>
<p>Customers can pay with multiple tender types and can accept two or more payment types in a single transaction. Many POS systems are tailor-made and marketed to specific types of businesses, especially full-service restaurants or retail. Depending on the software, merchants can track not only their sales but also inventory levels, gross revenues, profit margins, sales patterns and a whole host of other data points.</p>
<p>Manage Specials - POS systems automate the process of tracking current and marked down pricing. Bar menus change all the time, and your point of sale system should adapt to it. Whether you offer happy hour specials or a new food item on your menu, you want a system that can sync all the information. Improves inventory management, a crucial component of a busy deli. Menu item cost is a significant result of how computer technology improves bar and grill business.</p>
<p>Some bars even implement mobile POS systems at tables, which allow customers to order, pay and perform other collective actions, without having to attract the attention of the staff. Its rich features with no hidden fees make it lucrative for many small businesses. EPOS has a lot of very specific configuration options, perfectly suited for cafe, restaurant, and bar owners. From its start as part of an initial purchase order, to its receipt in the store or warehouse, as it is transferred between locations, when it is counted and re-counted - and eventually as part of a sale from the POS.</p>

<p>If you're choosing a POS system for the first time, start making a list of features you must have and talk to fellow business owners who are operating in a similar space.

<p>It's the tool you use to analyze and order your inventory, employees, customers, and sales. We have been providing a bar & restaurant point of sale (POS) system for years.
