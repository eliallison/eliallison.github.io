<p>Point of sale (POS) can be referred to as a check-out or cash wrap and is usually the location in a store or restaurant where transactions for the exchange goods and services occur. Some retailers choose to operate an RMS by assembling the various pieces from different software vendors: a POS system from Vendor A, an inventory management system from Vendor B, purchasing management from Vendor C, a business intelligence tool from Vendor D, an ecommerce system from Vendor E and so on. The costs of implementing multiple disparate systems and getting them to work together in harmony is prohibitive for all but the largest retail businesses.</p>
<p>For over 40 years, RSI's commitment to the growing and fast changing worlds of Retail, Hospitality and Security has allowed us to partner with multiple POS and Security providers, making it possible to have a POS solution for every type of business.

This will include hardware components like credit card readers, touchscreen monitors, receipt printers, and barcode scanners. Traditional card machines require software installation (if not included) and SIM card or landline cable, while app-based card readers use WiFi or network data from a connected mobile device.</p>
