<p>The newest revelations to take the restaurant and hospitality industries by force - quickly etching its way into "trendsetter" capacity - are point-of-sale systems that are powered by feature-rich and slim iPad tablets.

Now how the software works is that every time an item is scanned it will be deducted from the inventory database.</p>
