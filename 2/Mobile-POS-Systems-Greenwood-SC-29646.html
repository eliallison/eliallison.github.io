<p>Choosing the right retail point of sale system and software is not a decision to take lightly. This means that, in order to access the capabilities that point of sale systems boast, you'll have to pay a fee to access the software that provides them. Cloud POS from an organization like Oracle gives you the benefit of millions of dollars of investment in data security hardware and software, which helps protect your guests and your business from hackers. This helps retailers keep track of their customers' purchases and allow them to serve them better.</p>
<p>The system should facilitate the creation of multiple returns for one sales order at different time intervals. Along with an easy-to-use tablet point of sale, NCR Silver Pro Restaurant is a cloud-based POS software that delivers added benefits such as happy hour pricing, customized floor plans and house accounts valued by full service restaurants and pubs. If you plan to integrate your POS system with other software and services - such as accounting software, CMS platforms, customer loyalty programs and appointment management apps - you'll want to find out ahead of time if the integration costs extra, and whether it's a one-time or recurring fee.</p>
