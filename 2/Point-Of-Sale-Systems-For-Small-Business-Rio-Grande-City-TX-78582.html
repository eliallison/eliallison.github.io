<p>When you are decided to get started in a restaurant business, there is no simpler way to get going but by opening a small pizza shop. Choosing a POS software vendor that offers proprietary hardware can save you time while offering smoother functionality. Easy to use - Tablet and mobile POS are easier to use because the staff is already familiar with using mobile devices so that the learning curve can be shorter over the traditional point of sale machines and software. Our parent company Point of Sale USA maintains a list of the top restaurant POS systems in the industry with individual reviews to help you compare and find the right solution for your business.</p>
<p>Features include order management, a delivery app for drivers, employee scheduling and a timeclock, ingredient-based inventory tracking, and reporting tools. The software is essentially an online ordering platform for restaurants, convenience stores, takeaways, multi-store chains, cafes, delis, and franchises. ShopKeep doesn't allow for multiple sales tax rates, doesn't integrate with any online stores, and can't handle payment with gift cards.</p>
