<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. Many POS systems run on tablets, an option that is increasingly popular with small business owners because they're less expensive and easier to set up and use than their old-school counterparts. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments. Be cautious, therefore, about setting up with Quickbooks or other proprietary POS software systems.</p>
<p>For over 40 years, RSI's commitment to the growing and fast changing worlds of Retail, Hospitality and Security has allowed us to partner with multiple POS and Security providers, making it possible to have a POS solution for every type of business. It cuts down on paperwork by automating the reconciliation of cash and card payments. Cloud-based, SaaS options mean retailers can spread costs over time, rather than make a large capital expenditure on a new system.</p>
<h2>Choosing A Point Of Sale System For Your Restaurant Walpole</h2>
<p>The technologically advanced AccuPOS delivers an inventory management system that integrates with popular accounting platforms. Real-time inventory management should ensure you don't run out of stock and compromise customer reception to your business, while API support should let you integrate with third-party applications as you require them. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity.</p>
<p>The point of sale system can be integrated with your other systems and software such as eCommerce platforms, accounting apps, ERP and warehouse systems. Splitting the bill across multiple credit cards is a common occurrence at restaurants and bars.
