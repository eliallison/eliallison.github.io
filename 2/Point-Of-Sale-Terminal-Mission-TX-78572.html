You can accept payment right in the online invoice, and customers can pay by credit card, Apple Pay, free ACH bank transfer, or over the phone.</p>
<p>Now, customers can walk into a bar and grill having already placed their order before they left the office.

Small businesses can take advantage of simple credit card processing, which is integrated with Quickbooks and encrypted for the protection of the business and its customers' data.</p>
