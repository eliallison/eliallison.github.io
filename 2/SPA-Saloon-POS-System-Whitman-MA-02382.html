<p>The advanced POS solutions offer sales trends like seasonal demand in products and information related to stock management. Point-of-sale systems, or POS, are the retail software and hardware merchants use to process in-person transactions. POS once referred only to the site—typically, a counter with a cash register where customers handed over cash for goods and services. Traditionally, POS systems were physical cash registers that accepted only cash, checks, and credit cards.</p>
<p>Nowadays cash registers have become more sophisticated and they are used to process credit cards. Epos Now also makes it easy to manage employee timesheets and payroll as staff can clock in and out directly through the POS system. Proprietary POS hardware is designed to work only with vendor-specific software, typically allowing for smoother functionality. For retailers, that means saving—and even increasing—in-store sales with empowered commerce capabilities that allow customers to buy, pick up, or return items via any channel.</p>
