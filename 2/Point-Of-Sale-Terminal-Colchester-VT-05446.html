<p>It's hard to envision a retail or point of sale (POS) environment that doesn't make use of touch technology. Relevant data is where data-driven profit begins, and user-defined fields in Retail Pro POS give you flexibility to add the fields for which you want to gather data. Our retail team would come to us with a bottleneck in the process, and we would create customizations in Retail Pro to fix it. We're always finding new ways to increase efficiency in our stores. The retailers can bring incentives, cross-sell, interact with shoppers, and up-sell by swiping a loyalty card.</p>

In addition to the TouchSuite Restaurant POS system, it resells Grubbrr kiosks and POS hardware for Clover, Talech, QuickBooks POS, and NCR Silver. Go for EMV-compliant POS (see above explanation) to protect customers and yourself from credit card fraud.</p>
