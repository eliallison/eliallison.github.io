<p>It used to be that for a small retail business, a cash register and a black-box credit card terminal were sufficient. Before the introduction of technology into the restaurants, bills were traditionally generated by merely calculating the order value manually and giving customers a handwritten receipt. The payment options offered, the speed of the transaction, and the ability to tailor the transaction to the customers' needs each have profound impacts on customer satisfaction and your overall business success. It is advisable to use your POS computer exclusively for the purpose it is meant for - recording sales transactions, generating reports and managing inventory.</p>

<p>Point-of-sale systems, as a result, are basically cash registers on steroids.” POS software expanded the basics of the cash register directly into credit card payment processors and back-end accounting.

<p>The only major complaint with QuickBooks is that it isn't recommended for many basic types of businesses, including full-service restaurants and retail stores with brick-and-mortar locations. There are hundreds of different kinds of retail management systems on the market. Internet disconnection is no problem as you can continue with your selling operation with the system automatically resyncing your sales when you get back online.</p>
<p>With the POS software, you don't need terminals, cash registers, barcode scanners, or receipt and label printers. But just because you have someone on the phone doesn't mean your system is back online; you're still losing revenue every time an impatient customer walks out of the store. For a restaurant, it's especially important to turn over tables quickly and ensure that customers receive the correct food (with any special orders accommodated) in a timely fashion.</p>
