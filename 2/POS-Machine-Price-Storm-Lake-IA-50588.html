At any time shopkeeper can have a track on total sales which can be further bifurcated in cash and debit card.

<p>The best POS system for retail stores is Vend because it's an end-to-end cloud POS solution that helps entrepreneurs sell online and in-store. Offer customers the option of leaving a security deposit or partial payment towards items instead of paying all at once. Modern retail is online, in-store and mobile, so get the point of sale system that takes you where you need to go.

<p>So, while your sales associate is looking up stock availability from Retail Pro on an iPad or iPod Touch (or any other mobile device), they can also look up the customer's transaction history and make recommendations for cool sweaters or tees to complete their look. When you open a restaurant, cafe or bar, you need a point-of-sale system to accept credit and debit payments. Generally, if not for aesthetic purposes, the business is only using one of these because they do not have the budget for a better cash management system.</p>
