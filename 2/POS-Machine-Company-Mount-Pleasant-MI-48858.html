<p>Most of us remember the early days when retail systems were just a cash register. Hardware â€” Many POS systems come with hardware such as cash drawers, tablets, card readers, and ticket printers. You can download and install Retail Plus POS software in a matter of minutes. By setting minimum stock number and restocking levels a restaurant can maximize their revenue by creating accurate orders that reflect the sales patterns the software reveals. ShopKeep helps small business owners focus on providing excellent customer service by minimizing the time it takes to complete routine tasks.</p>
<p>Infinity POS is always on and offers near real-time customer and offer information that staff can use to encourage purchase and upsell.

We've been assisting and simplifying the daily routine of retail businesses since 2001.</p>
