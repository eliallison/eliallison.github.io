<p>POS stands for "point of sale" and it is generally used to describe the computer used to check out customers. With a good (POS) point of sale system, you can keep customers loyal, and keep them spending. By nature of processing the outward flow of your business's inventory, point of sale systems—the best ones, anyway—keep track of where your inventory currently stands. When doing so, remember that you will need to invest in a server (unless the system will work with your existing one) retail software, accounting software, terminals (how many will you need?) Talking to other business owners is a good way to get an idea of the range of what's out there in terms of price.</p>
<p>A point of sale system is like a computerized cash register, it has the ability to manage inventory, creates an easier system of taking orders, increases profit and will increase the overall productivity of both your wait and kitchen staffs.

Before the POS was introduced, businesses used old-school cash tills or registers to manually process transactions.</p>
