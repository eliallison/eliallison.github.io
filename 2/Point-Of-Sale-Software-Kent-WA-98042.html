<h3>Point Of Sale (POS) Software Kent Washington</h3>
<p>Payment by check has historically offered an opportunity for fraud and lost revenues, but modern point of sale systems have introduced security tools to help minimize this possibility. Integrated employee time card systems schedule hours and generate payroll, and the inventory is intelligent and self-managing (set the items just one time and the inventory tracks and manages them from there on out, sending key alerts when items need to be reordered, and even printing order forms for vendors).</p>
<p>We are honored to announce that the cross-platform, cross-channel POS and retail management software Retail Pro® was ranked number 1 retail mid-market POS in market share, global reach, innovation, and growth in the latest Retail Executive Advisory Program Research Study from IHL Group. If you are processing a layaway, you have to remove the merchandise from the floor yourself, because POS does not remove it from inventory until you actually sell it, and another sales associate may think you still have the item in stock.</p>
