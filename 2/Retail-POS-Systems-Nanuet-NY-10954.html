<p>It is important that the choice of POS software is compatible with the choice of POS peripherals or hardwares. In most cases, a point of sale (POS) system is a hardware and software system that processes transactions and records data. 2. QuickBooks Point of Sale Pro Package - offers advanced tools and allows several options for customization so you can manage sales, inventory, and your customers in the way that you want. As well, businesses can keep track of peak selling periods so they can adjust employee schedules based on the time of day when the volume of traffic is high.</p>
