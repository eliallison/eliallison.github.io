<p>The advanced POS solutions offer sales trends like seasonal demand in products and information related to stock management. Point-of-sale systems, or POS, are the retail software and hardware merchants use to process in-person transactions.

Traditionally, POS systems were physical cash registers that accepted only cash, checks, and credit cards.</p>
<p>Using IoT and POS technology, these instant discounts and offers can be personalized according to the shopper's buying habits and behaviour, thus increasing sales. In some industries, mobile apps might replace some popular uses such as check-ins and product look-up or even ticket sales. These systems have extensive capabilities including inventory management, reporting and analytics, payment receipts via email, CRM and customer loyalty programs.</p>
