<p>POS is a short form for point of sale. Users can utilize numerous features for managing customer information, dashboards and reports, promotions and pricing, main product catalog, orders, inventory, and cash. However, a POS terminal is the electronic equipment performing the sales transaction and processing the credit card payments. Lightspeed users can also consult the Lightspeed Community to discuss their POS system with other retailers, restaurateurs and Lightspeed experts.</p>
<p>POS systems still include both software and hardware components, but they now also offer many new functions as well. Retail merchants, for example, can operate with an internet-enabled device, terminal stand, credit card reader, receipt printer, and cash drawer.
