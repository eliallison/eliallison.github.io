<p>Bar staff often work without direct supervision and liquor waste and theft is hard to detect or prevent. Many systems also feature add-on modules such as payroll time clocks and customer preference databases. Technological advances such as point of sale systems, email ordering and computerized kitchens have taken fast service to a new level. Flexibility - At this point, many POS transactions are card-based, not cash-based. ShopKeep can be used for payment processing, inventory management, transactions, customer marketing, staff management, reporting and analytics, and more.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>
