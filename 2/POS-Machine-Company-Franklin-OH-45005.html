<p>When you are just getting started with a new retail business and are wondering whether you should install one or more retail POS software and retail POS hardware, then in this article we will discuss three distinct advantages of retail point of sale, POS, solution over the usual cash register solution. While point of sale systems come in many shapes, sizes, and price tags, we are only going to focus on one type of POS system in this article. It helps to increase sales, improve service, and review reports to check on the performance of servers. Celerant, Intuit, MICROS Retail, Microsoft, NCR, Oracle, and SAP are the most popular POS software solution providers. In order to take payment from cards with a chip, your credit card reader will need to accept what is known as EMV payment —a global standard for chip-based debit and credit card transactions.</p>
<p>The system features automatic invoicing, barcode scanning, debit card PIN processing and digital receipts. A small business should not have to pay for an entire support division just for their point of sale software. Bluestore Live offers retailers a flexible point of sale system that can run on different hardware. We know how many hats business owners wear each day and created an ePOS software and eCommerce system that simply works well and works right, while enabling a competitive advantage.</p>

Your POS system may include terminals, credit card readers, barcode scanners, cash drawers, and online e-commerce platforms. The good news is you can always find a different restaurant POS solution, either as a standalone product, or bundled within a larger venue management kit with multiple attractive functionalities.</p>
<p>Before we jump into that, let's look at why you need a POS system , as well as the features you should look for in your POS software. KORONA integrates with a variety of EMV and mobile-compatible payment terminals without forcing retailers into one specific credit card processor. We offer a local server based point of sale system with the reliability of traditional systems and the cloud functions that every business needs.</p>
