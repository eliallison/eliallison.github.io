<p>When you are decided to get started in a restaurant business, there is no simpler way to get going but by opening a small pizza shop. Choosing a POS software vendor that offers proprietary hardware can save you time while offering smoother functionality. Easy to use - Tablet and mobile POS are easier to use because the staff is already familiar with using mobile devices so that the learning curve can be shorter over the traditional point of sale machines and software. Our parent company Point of Sale USA maintains a list of the top restaurant POS systems in the industry with individual reviews to help you compare and find the right solution for your business.</p>
<p>I use livepos in my store, it has the features I need to run my business. Apply surcharges or discounts and accept cash, credit cards, account sales and more. Although we don't sell Apple iPads, our restaurant POS software works on tablets running Windows 8 or Windows 10.

Online ordering — Customers love having the ability to order food online, so it makes sense to get in on the action.</p>
<h2>Manage Your Small Business Restaurant With A POS System Little Falls</h2>
<p>It fulfills all our requirements and fits our budget, way more than I expected from a restaurant POS software. When determining how much a bar POS system will cost your business, you must first decide if you are going to lease or purchase your hardware. If you are operating a small or midsize bar, cloud-based POS software is likely the best option for your business. And with QuickBooks hardware and software, you can take any type of payment from just about any device—barcode scanner, touch screen terminal, iPad, or mobile reader.</p>
<p>Cross Channel returns management- The POS returns management system accepts the cross-channel returns and assists in refunds along with replacements from any type of store location. More importantly, however, the right POS system will allow bar and nightclub staff to spend less time in front of the screen and more time in front of customers, pouring delicious drinks. In a way, this is similar to the purpose behind restaurants: A restaurant's basic function is to feed people, but you and your staff do way more than that by creating delightful, memorable dining experiences.</p>
<p>It's also easy to open and close tabs for customers by simply swiping their credit card through the system. The Lightspeed restaurant EPOS also comes equipped with a high-tech restaurant management software which can be customised to your needs. Sales - Simplified checkouts for both, business and customers. Card machine: Used to process payments made by debit or credit cards or mobile wallets via NFC. Accept cash in multiple currencies that are acceptable at your property, process credit cards directly through the system, or bill direct to the company.</p>
