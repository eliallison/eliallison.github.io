<p>POS is a short form for point of sale. Users can utilize numerous features for managing customer information, dashboards and reports, promotions and pricing, main product catalog, orders, inventory, and cash. However, a POS terminal is the electronic equipment performing the sales transaction and processing the credit card payments. Lightspeed users can also consult the Lightspeed Community to discuss their POS system with other retailers, restaurateurs and Lightspeed experts.</p>

<h3>Best Point Of Sale Software (POS) Morton Grove Illinois</h3>
<p>You have access to features like table management, delivery, and cash management.

<h3>POS Software For Sale Morton Grove IL 60053</h3>
<p>Installation and set up - The POS system involves physical hardware components and software system data. This software is popular among small retail businesses because of its clear, unlimited, and no-hidden charges plans. To make things easier and more convenient for you, Upserve offers one of the best management integrations in the restaurant industry. POS systems have enabled anyone, from business-savvy entrepreneurs to artisans who want to turn their passion into their profession, to open a retail store and grow.</p>
<p>Since implementation of a POS system is requires a large investment in time and money, the selection of software and hardware requires careful research into the features available and associated costs. For keyed-in transactions, customers pay a 3.5% transaction cost plus $0.15. Customers who personally use their card to dip, tap, and swipe, they pay slightly lower transaction fees (2.75%). Many small businesses benefit from buying their POS hardware outright, since POS leases can be tied to credit card processing and have lengthy contracts.</p>
