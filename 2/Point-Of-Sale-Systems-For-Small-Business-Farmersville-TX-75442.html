<p>If one of your bartenders is being trained for a management position, for example, and you want to provide her with access to your labor reports, you can do so without assigning a default permission to all of your bartenders.

I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc.</p>
