<p>ShopKeep can save you time and hassles with its powerful inventory management tools built into a solid iPad POS system. Alongside menu management are the inventory tracking functions. Consumers today tend to prefer paying with a credit card rather than using cash. Customers can browse through the menu on the tablet and place their orders which are then sent to the kitchen. It has all the features that can help improve and enhance every possible function within a restaurant.</p>
<p>Since implementation of a POS system is requires a large investment in time and money, the selection of software and hardware requires careful research into the features available and associated costs. For keyed-in transactions, customers pay a 3.5% transaction cost plus $0.15. Customers who personally use their card to dip, tap, and swipe, they pay slightly lower transaction fees (2.75%). Many small businesses benefit from buying their POS hardware outright, since POS leases can be tied to credit card processing and have lengthy contracts.</p>
