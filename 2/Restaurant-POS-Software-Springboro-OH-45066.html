<p>The core of hospitality or retail business, for that matter any trade, is the cash register. A POS system provides the latest sales reports for the day, week, month, or year. You'll want to use POS software that integrates seamlessly with your other systems and causes limited disruption. In essence, Upserve POS provides tools for customer management, restaurant management, table management, and specialty order processing. Some restaurant point of sale systems come standard with an "86 Item Countdown" feature that displays actual counts, deducts from the count when an item is sold and then prevents sales of the item once it is sold out.</p>
<p>Having an efficient Point of Sale (POS) solution can go a long way in ensuring that all your business operations are running smoothly. Simplifying transaction and record keeping, and eliminating the need for separate point of sale terminals, businesses will have more time to focus on customer service. Some of the features sets you want to look for are inventory, customer and employee management. Provides an invaluable tool that allows you to not only process purchases but integrates inventory, customer info, returns, exchanges, credit card processing, rewards programs, sales, records, etc all on one machine.</p>
