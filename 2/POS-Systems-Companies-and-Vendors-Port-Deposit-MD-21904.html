<p>Like their printer counterpart an all-in-one POS system combines multiple technologies and integrates them into one housing to maximize value plus convenience to the end user. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.</p>
<p>Inventory management is the process of controlling costs and waste through effective use of on-hand product. Epos Now is an award-winning POS system trusted by hospitality businesses like Best Western Hotels and Subway Restaurants. With a solid POS retail system, it will be easy to correlate that person or persons work schedule with the minute-to-minute sales information. Epos is easy to use so staff can start using the system almost immediately.</p>

Furthermore, it can serve as an advertising platform, where stores can run marketing messages and promotions, thereby potentially enhancing sales.</p>
