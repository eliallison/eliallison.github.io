<p>Learn what features to look for when choosing the best retail POS system for your company. ChronitoPOS makes customer relationship management easy. Reprint this ticket 10 times and sell and collect for themselves these reprinted receipts instead of ringing up new customers. The software lets you stay on top of purchase orders, keep tabs on vendor orders by product, organize multiple vendors in one place, as well as run reports to instantly see your best sellers, total sales, and total taxes. Toast itself acts as the client's payment processor, and unlike many of its iOS-based competitors in the POS world, runs on Android operating systems, making it at once cheaper and more versatile.</p>
<p>It works with all major credit card processors and POS equipment. Customers can also interact directly with POS systems, particularly in the hospitality industry. Options like an online appointment calendar, appointment reminders, customer database with details for a previous haircut or nails styles, retail functionality, inventory management, online employee scheduling, and employee management are all vital to have.</p>

<p>It's not all third-party integrations, of course: Within the software interface itself, ingredients can be tracked individually through the inventory management features, a floor plan display helps guide servers to the table they need when they need it, and a menu that supports photos of each meal to be included with each description. Mentioned above is the list of some of the best restaurant management software available for purchase.</p>
