<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. Many POS systems run on tablets, an option that is increasingly popular with small business owners because they're less expensive and easier to set up and use than their old-school counterparts. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments. Be cautious, therefore, about setting up with Quickbooks or other proprietary POS software systems.</p>
<p>This simple and powerful inventory management software tracks your sales data in real-time. Our POS software enables restaurateurs to improve the profitability of their business through faster and more accurate order processing, multiple integrated modules like customer interface, employee interface, and access to 100+ reports. An online restaurant management system is essentially a web application that is developed to automate the daily activities of a restaurant.</p>

Your POS may be able to take some of the more tedious or time-consuming parts of owning a small business off your hands, dramatically improving your efficiency. The best restaurant POS systems are so much more than order and till systems. As is based on the same platform as our Hostel PMS, the two systems are totally integrated - and all revenue postings from the POS are pushed to the PMS (regardless of folio charge or cash payment data).</p>
<p>Managing inventory is said to be the most time-consuming and labor-intensive task in the retail business process. The modern day POS system replaces legacy equipment like the old plug-in calculators, carbon copy credit card receipts and 10-digit registers (if you can remember back that far). Different types of restaurants have specific operational needs that must be met, and a good POS system must address those needs through the basic hardware as well as the software interface.</p>

You can accept payment right in the online invoice, and customers can pay by credit card, Apple Pay, free ACH bank transfer, or over the phone.</p>

Features include appointment scheduling, employee management, inventory tracking, integrated payment processing, and gift card and loyalty programs.</p>
