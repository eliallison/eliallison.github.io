<p>While your business may not be big enough to go this route and also you may have other reasons to keep an employee at your point of sale the fact is, that today high tech retail systems are just that simple to operate. These can be expanded and improved upon by using additional hardware, such as barcode scanners, card readers, or other software modules. Retailers also have certain functionality that should be incorporated in the POS system, spanning from an inventory library to keep track of stock levels to hardware tools like a scale on the counter (for food priced according to weight), barcode scanner and a device for taking off alarm tags of liquor bottles or clothes.</p>
