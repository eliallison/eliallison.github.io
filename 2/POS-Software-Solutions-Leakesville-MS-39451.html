<p>This feature has been around since I started in the cash register business some 25+ years ago. Formerly known as iConnect, Franpos provides POS solutions with comprehensive features to franchise businesses. Our Point of Sale for Restaurants offers full stock control, debtors, creditors, recipe and staff management to manage your entire restaurant alongside all the great features that are required to keep you informed on what is happening in your business. It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>
<p>Retailers and restaurants can benefit from comprehensive data analytics and sales processing. One thing to watch out for is that sometimes these features are included in the basic monthly software fee while other times they need to be purchased, upping the price. Below we have compiled some of the most popular types of POS systems and what features and tools they usually come with to help you figure out what will most benefit your business.</p>

Many POS software can be integrated to 3rd party software such as accounting software for bookkeeping, email marketing solutions, and ecommerce platforms for selling online.</p>

The times when a bar manager had to spend half of their day working with spreadsheets are over.

<h3>POS For Small Retail Business Leakesville MS 39451</h3>
<p>Whether you opt for the Basic, Pro, or Multi-Store version of QuickBooks point of sale, you'll simply have to pay for it with a one-off, lump sum payment. This can also work in tandem with payroll deductions in staff cafeterias or coffee shops using our state of the art cashless payment software in an all-inclusive integrated system.
