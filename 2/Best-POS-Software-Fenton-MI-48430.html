<p>It's hard to envision a retail or point of sale (POS) environment that doesn't make use of touch technology. Relevant data is where data-driven profit begins, and user-defined fields in Retail Pro POS give you flexibility to add the fields for which you want to gather data. Our retail team would come to us with a bottleneck in the process, and we would create customizations in Retail Pro to fix it. We're always finding new ways to increase efficiency in our stores. The retailers can bring incentives, cross-sell, interact with shoppers, and up-sell by swiping a loyalty card.</p>
<p>With the bar tab feature, pre-authorize credit cards so collecting payment is a breeze, and feel at ease because you won't be responsible for a stack of credit cards sitting behind the bar any longer. Likewise, gift and loyalty programs—whether for retail or hospitality customers —can turn payment into a personalized guest experience in which you reward customers, run targeted promotions, and gather key data on preferences and behaviors.</p>
<h2>Hospitality POS (Point Of Sale) Systems & Software Fenton</h2>
<p>Some systems offer both inventory control and accounting modules but most successful retailers use completely different systems for each one. Other features include a 360-degree Point-of-Sale Software with Recurring Billing, Sales & Order Reporting, and Electronic Invoicing. KORONA's retail POS systems store your data using cloud POS technology. I'm talking about typical restaurants, cafes, coffee shops, bars, etc.</p>
<p>As the need for a more efficient and highly secure payment process is ever increasing, POS systems are an important asset to the success of any retail business. If you're currently using Shopify to sell online, then using Shopify POS for in-store transactions is a no-brainer. Stock Visibility — keeping track of product movement can help retailers avoid stock-outs or dead stocks and thus improve customer relationships.</p>
<p>Managing inventory is said to be the most time-consuming and labor-intensive task in the retail business process. The modern day POS system replaces legacy equipment like the old plug-in calculators, carbon copy credit card receipts and 10-digit registers (if you can remember back that far). Different types of restaurants have specific operational needs that must be met, and a good POS system must address those needs through the basic hardware as well as the software interface.</p>

<p>Cloud-based POS systems that offer enterprise reporting give owners and managers secure access to detailed sales, inventory, and labor reports across all of their businesses or segmented for each individual location.
