By integrating your POS system with the ERP system, Business Central , you avoid entering the same data in multiple systems as all transactions are posted automatically.

<p>Customer data capture and management are key in the development of our retail systems and Retail Pro allows for much improved processes and usability in terms of CRM and stock management. For example, having your inventory data visibility across stores means when your store is out of stock on a particular product, sales associates can check its availability at other locations.
