<p>Bar staff often work without direct supervision and liquor waste and theft is hard to detect or prevent. Many systems also feature add-on modules such as payroll time clocks and customer preference databases. Technological advances such as point of sale systems, email ordering and computerized kitchens have taken fast service to a new level. Flexibility - At this point, many POS transactions are card-based, not cash-based. ShopKeep can be used for payment processing, inventory management, transactions, customer marketing, staff management, reporting and analytics, and more.</p>

Finally, accepting contactless payments will make the checkout process that much more convenient for your customers. Unlike other POS systems, you're not locked into using one specific payment provider That way you're free to use whoever's offering the best rate.</p>

<p>Also, since your revenues will rise, spending time on forecasting and analysis will have a bigger return on investment, so we added features of a POS system that will help you with forecasting as well. Another advantage associated with Point of Sale software for restaurants is its real-time integration with inventory management. It is wise to use the POS computer for only sales transactions, reports, and inventory control, and isolate use of POS computers from general purpose activities.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you choose cloud-based or local, server-based POS software, make sure the system is compatible with your payment processor and has the add-ons you require. Meet the real side of your retail business and never again blind-guess your store performance. There are many kinds of payment processing solutions available to use such as new mobile payment methods and credit card readers, however, the POS systems we reviewed for this article are full-on cash registers.</p>
<p>This is why I recommend taking your time and assessing the various people you will rely on to make the software work for your business.

The POS hardware includes an internet-enabled device that can run the POS software, plus transaction tools like a receipt printer and a cash drawer.</p>
