<p>When it comes to choosing the right Linux POS software for your business it is important that you know what the advantages and disadvantages are to be had from the Linux based ones. Extend your operations by adding more add-ons on this POS software to give more ease to customers. Add to that robust multi-location management tools and an amazing array of ready integrations, and you tailor Lightspeed to fit your exact bar service needs. Contact our Retail Solutions Specialists at sales@ or sign up for a free account and see how Vend works with your store's existing hardware. Inventory management is a key omnichannel challenge and accurate allocation and replenishment are critical to customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>

This will include hardware components like credit card readers, touchscreen monitors, receipt printers, and barcode scanners.
