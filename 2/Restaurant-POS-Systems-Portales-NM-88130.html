Customer relationship - By storing customer data and purchase history, the POS system helps in retaining the customers.

When success depends on superior service, you need flexible POS software and Back-Office solutions for managing every aspect of your restaurant business. Many POS software can be integrated to 3rd party software such as accounting software for bookkeeping, email marketing solutions, and ecommerce platforms for selling online.</p>

This comprehensive iPad POS system has cloud-based features for managing marketing, booking, registrations, inventory, and staff management. Another feature-rich free POS software is Linga , which is designed specifically for food service businesses. An all-inclusive restaurant management software helps maximize profits and reduce costs.</p>
<p>Manage your business with a robust iPad POS system. Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city. There is only 1 thing we can think of that will drive customers away faster than bad food and that is slow service.</p>
