<p>This feature has been around since I started in the cash register business some 25+ years ago. Formerly known as iConnect, Franpos provides POS solutions with comprehensive features to franchise businesses. Our Point of Sale for Restaurants offers full stock control, debtors, creditors, recipe and staff management to manage your entire restaurant alongside all the great features that are required to keep you informed on what is happening in your business. It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>
