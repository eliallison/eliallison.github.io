<p>A supermarket with high traffic cannot afford a systemic failure, hence each point of sale station should not only be very robust both in terms of software, database and hardware specifications but also designed in such a way as to prevent causing a systemic failure - such as may happen through the use of a single central database for operations. Let your customers shop their way with the ability to refund or exchange online purchases at any retail location.</p>
<p>For store-owners in any business, it is important to maintain a cash counter for payment purposes. For retail stores, winning shoppers' loyalty is accomplished when their needs are met and their shopping experience leaves them satisfied that they received quality products at competitive prices and great customer service. However, to take advantage of all of Rezku's features, large restaurants get more for their investment.</p>
