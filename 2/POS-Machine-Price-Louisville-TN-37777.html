<p>Purchasing a restaurant POS system on the internet can be a complex process due to the number of systems and options. After the pen and paper way of taking orders, the next thing to enter the restaurant industry was the first POS system It was a basic cash register, a computer-based system introduced by IBM. 5. Point of sale systems allow you to track what customers purchase so that you can learn more about your customers, their buying habits, and personal preferences. Clover also features advanced loyalty tools to help you attract repeat customers.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>
