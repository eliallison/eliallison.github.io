More importantly, however, the right POS system will allow bar and nightclub staff to spend less time in front of the screen and more time in front of customers, pouring delicious drinks. In a way, this is similar to the purpose behind restaurants: A restaurant's basic function is to feed people, but you and your staff do way more than that by creating delightful, memorable dining experiences.</p>
<p>A few services, such as Square Point of Sale, offer POS services for free, as long as you process your payments through them.
