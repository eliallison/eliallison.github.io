<p>Onetap is hospitality point of sale, stock control, customer loyalty, reporting and integrated software using smart technology for restaurants, cafes, bars and more. You also get dashboards, retail, and product report to gain insights into your store's growth and sales performance. If you already own a PC you can "create" a POS by purchasing the POS software and adding the peripherals you will need such as a cash drawer, credit card swiper, etc. High-traffic operations such as grocery outlets and cafes need to process sales quickly at the sales counter so the UI flow is often designed with as few popups or other interruptions to ensure the operator isn't distracted and the transaction can be processed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>
