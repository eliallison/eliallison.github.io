<p>Point of sale (POS) can be referred to as a check-out or cash wrap and is usually the location in a store or restaurant where transactions for the exchange goods and services occur. Some retailers choose to operate an RMS by assembling the various pieces from different software vendors: a POS system from Vendor A, an inventory management system from Vendor B, purchasing management from Vendor C, a business intelligence tool from Vendor D, an ecommerce system from Vendor E and so on. The costs of implementing multiple disparate systems and getting them to work together in harmony is prohibitive for all but the largest retail businesses.</p>
<p>Recent research, Retail in 4 Dimensions , shows 60 percent of consumers surveyed want mobile payment options in-store. Different types of restaurants have different software needs, so when choosing your POS system you must first start by considering the type of food service you are running and then matching it up with the system that will be most productive for you and your business. The customer should be able to add to their balance at any time, making the gift card like your own private debit card system.</p>

<p>Restaurant owners were quick to realize that just acquiring customers was not enough. By integrating your POS system with the ERP system, Business Central , you avoid entering the same data in multiple systems as all transactions are posted automatically.

<p>You'll need to consider software for restaurant and bar inventory, purchase and invoicing, accounting, reservation, and scheduling. While some retailers still use systems as described above, many are moving on to advanced cloud-based POS systems where data is stored online.
