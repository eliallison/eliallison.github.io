<p>Any retail store that wants to stay in business for a long time will appreciate every customer that walks through the front door; the question is whether or not they will choose to display that appreciation. Nowadays POS systems are also used in goods and property leasing businesses, equipment repair shops, healthcare management, ticketing offices such as cinemas and sports facilities and many other operations where capabilities such as the following are required: processing monetary transactions, allocation and scheduling of facilities, keeping record and scheduling services rendered to customers, tracking of goods and processes (repair or manufacture), invoicing and tracking of debts and outstanding payments.</p>
<p>For over 40 years, RSI's commitment to the growing and fast changing worlds of Retail, Hospitality and Security has allowed us to partner with multiple POS and Security providers, making it possible to have a POS solution for every type of business. It cuts down on paperwork by automating the reconciliation of cash and card payments. Cloud-based, SaaS options mean retailers can spread costs over time, rather than make a large capital expenditure on a new system.</p>

<p>Its Brink POS software is designed for quick-service and fast casual eateries, and its PixelPoint POS is for full-service restaurants. In addition to being significantly less expensive than traditional legacy point of sale systems, the real strength of a cloud based point of sale system is that there are developers all over the world creating software applications for cloud based POS. As well as providing staff with an easy to use touch screen pos system that increases customer service, the upgraded point of sale systems increase staff efficiency in so many ways.</p>
<p>Remote access allows business owners to view how sales are going even when they are not at the restaurant itself. These businesses should look for features like invoicing, e-commerce, and CRM. Proper use of these functions helps pinpoint the causes of inventory loss, reduces "out of stock" conditions and makes overall business management easier. In an effort to make retailers' lives easier, mobile POS system providers started taking payment processing in-house, officially removing complicated (and potentially risky ) third-party payment processors from the equation.</p>
