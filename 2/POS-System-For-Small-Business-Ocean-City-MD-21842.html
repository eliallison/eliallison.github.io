<p>Point of sale (POS) can be referred to as a check-out or cash wrap and is usually the location in a store or restaurant where transactions for the exchange goods and services occur. Some retailers choose to operate an RMS by assembling the various pieces from different software vendors: a POS system from Vendor A, an inventory management system from Vendor B, purchasing management from Vendor C, a business intelligence tool from Vendor D, an ecommerce system from Vendor E and so on. The costs of implementing multiple disparate systems and getting them to work together in harmony is prohibitive for all but the largest retail businesses.</p>

<p>My previous experience was also in e-commerce, so I'd seen the first-hand benefits that retail technology could have when it came to time savings and sales insights. Menu building — Building a menu can be a complex endeavor, but restaurant POS systems allow you to see your inventory and build a menu that's appropriate. Before the POS was introduced, businesses used old-school cash tills or registers to manually process transactions.</p>
