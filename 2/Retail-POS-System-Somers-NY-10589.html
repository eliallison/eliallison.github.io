<p>POS is a short form for point of sale. Users can utilize numerous features for managing customer information, dashboards and reports, promotions and pricing, main product catalog, orders, inventory, and cash. However, a POS terminal is the electronic equipment performing the sales transaction and processing the credit card payments. Lightspeed users can also consult the Lightspeed Community to discuss their POS system with other retailers, restaurateurs and Lightspeed experts.</p>
<p>With restaurant POS software, that can all be done using the tool. The point is to start with a checklist for evaluating restaurant POS systems. In addition to POS capabilities, it also comes with a Dine-In module to simplify table management, CRM, home delivery management, and live business dashboard. Whether your platform of choice is a traditional, PC-based point of sale system or a tablet POS system, the experts at pcAmerica can custom design a point of sale system to meet the unique needs of your business.</p>

And with QuickBooks hardware and software, you can take any type of payment from just about any device—barcode scanner, touch screen terminal, iPad, or mobile reader.</p>

<p>And many POS systems are capable of accepting almost any type of payment, including contactless payments like Apple Pay and Google Pay. That kind of (costly) frustration can't occur in retail stores. Ultimately, inventory is synchronized with less human error that is simply getting you real-time data and result for your business. Without a POS System, your customers will have to stand in a long line to wait for their checkout turn.</p>

With the ability to track reservations and know which tables are reserved at the beginning of service, it becomes much easier to seat walk-in customers.
