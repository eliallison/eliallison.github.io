<p>Whether you're selling gardening supplies, trendy clothes, or high-end electronics, your retail store's success is largely connected to your cash management procedures. And an open API makes adding third-party applications far easier than with the majority of restaurant POS systems. Customers appreciate when their food is delivered on time, and when their orders are not mixed up. For a restaurant this could mean greater customer retention, and more satisfied clients. By empowering in-store associates with a customer's purchase history, online browsing, and cart abandons, POS can increase basket size and same-store sales, even as you drive loyalty by exceeding customer expectations.</p>
<p>With the bar tab feature, pre-authorize credit cards so collecting payment is a breeze, and feel at ease because you won't be responsible for a stack of credit cards sitting behind the bar any longer. Likewise, gift and loyalty programs—whether for retail or hospitality customers —can turn payment into a personalized guest experience in which you reward customers, run targeted promotions, and gather key data on preferences and behaviors.</p>
